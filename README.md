# Artificial Intelligence 
## Dimitrios Gkegkas for the National Technology Univeristy of Athens

This is a repository for two assignments in AI. Each assignment is implemented in python and for presentation purposes a jupyter notebook has been made to show case the project.

. ## Assignment 1 - Pathfinding

The goal of this assignment is to implement some pathfinding algorithms. We start by creating the maps in a square grid making sure that at least one path exists from the start to the end point. Then we implement some pathfinding algorithms and finally we compare and test them.


. ## Assignment 2 - Recommdendation System

The goal of this assignment is to implement a recommendation system for movies.
